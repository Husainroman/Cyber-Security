                               Methods to find No Rate Limit Vulnerability
    
             No Rate-Limit on Account Creation
                a) we will send X number of simultaneous requests to the server and the server will act on each request
                b) thus by making X number of email account onto the website.
                c) no validation or limiting the request and taking decisions is very dangerous for an server.
                
             No Rate-limit leads to account takeover
                a) we will send X number of simultaneous requests to the server and the server will act on each request
                b) Thus by sending x number of a right OTP tokens or password we can successfully crack the code and
                   bypass the authentication 
                c) no validation or limiting the request and taking decisions by the server is very dangerous   
                
             No Rate-limit on OTP verify leads to Account takeover 
                a) we will send X number of simultaneous requests to the server and the server will act on each request
                b) Thus by sending x number of a right OTP tokens or password we can successfully crack the code and
                   bypass the authentication 
                c) no validation or limiting the request and taking decisions by the server is very dangerous   
                
             No-Rate limit protection bypass-1 
                a) we will send X number of simultaneous requests to the server and the server will act on each request
                b) We will do the bypass for No-Rate limit using race conditions and IP address.
                c) Thus by sending x number of a right OTP tokens or password we can successfully crack the code and
                   bypass the authentication 
                d) no validation or limiting the request and taking decisions by the server is very dangerous
                
             No-Rate limit protection bypass-2 
                a) we will send X number of simultaneous requests to the server and the server will act on each request
                b) we will do bypass for no rate-limit using X-Forwarded-Host
                c) Thus by sending x number of a right OTP tokens or password we can successfully crack the code and
                   bypass the authentication 
                d) no validation or limiting the request and taking decisions by the server is very dangerous
                
                
                                                           Mitigations
                                                           
                1) Always limit the requests by any user
                2) Verifying at the client side only and taking decisions is dangerous
                3) Rate-limit users based on IP's , NAH!
                4) Number of attempts for an account at server side
