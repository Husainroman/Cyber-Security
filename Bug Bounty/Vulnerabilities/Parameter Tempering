                                     Background Concept about Parameter Tampering 


The Web Parameter Tampering attack is based on the manipulation of parameters exchanged between client and server in order to modify application data, 
such as user credentials and permissions, price and quantity of products, etc.

Usually, this information is stored in cookies, hidden form fields, or URL Query Strings, and is used to increase application functionality and control.

Example 1
The parameter modification of form fields can be
considered a typical example of Web Parameter
Tampering attack.

● For example, consider a user who can select
form field values (combo box, check box, etc.) on
an application page. When these values are
submitted by the user, they could be acquired
and arbitrarily manipulated by an attacker.


Example 2
<input type=”hidden” id=”1008” name=”cost”
value=”70.00”>

● In this example, an attacker can modify the
“value” information of a specific item, thus
lowering its cost.


Example 3
http://www.attackbank.com/default.asp?
profile=741&debit=1000

● In this case, an attacker could tamper with the
URL, using other values for profile and debit:
http://www.attackbank.com/default.asp?
profile=852&debit=2000
