● Sender Policy Framework, or SPF, is a technical
standard that helps protect email senders and
recipients from spam, spoofing, and phishing. It is a
form of email authentication.

● Specifically, it defines a way to validate that an email
message was sent from an authorized mail server, in
order to detect forgery and to prevent spam. It was
designed to supplement SMTP, the basic protocol
used to send email, because SMTP does not itself
include any authentication mechanisms.


What is an SPF record?


An SPF record is included in an organization’s
DNS database. An SPF record is a speciallyformatted
version of a standard DNS TXT record.
An SPF record looks something like this:

v=spf1 include:_spf-a.microsoft.com include:_spfb.
microsoft.com include:_spf-c.microsoft.com
include:_spf-ssg-a.microsoft.com include:spfa.
hotmail.com ip4:147.243.128.24
ip4:147.243.128.26 ip4:147.243.1.153
ip4:147.243.1.47 ip4:147.243.1.48 -all
