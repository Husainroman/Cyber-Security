                                                  Background Concept about XSS


Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are a type of injection, in which malicious scripts are
injected into otherwise benign and trusted web sites. XSS attacks occur when an
attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, generally in the form of a
browser side script, to a different end user. Flaws that allow these attacks to succeed
are quite widespread and occur anywhere a web application uses input from a user
within the output it generates without validating or encoding it.

● An attacker can use XSS to send a malicious script to an unsuspecting user. The end
user’s browser has no way to know that the script should not be trusted, and will
execute the script. Because it thinks the script came from a trusted source, the
malicious script can access any cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive
information retained by the browser and used with that site.
