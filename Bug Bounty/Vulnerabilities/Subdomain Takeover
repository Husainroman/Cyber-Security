support.any.com from zendesk.com(support)

you pointed this subdomain to zendesk support 

later on you cancelled or service expired 


but you forgot to remote the redirection of pointining subdomain to zendesk.com {support}

if an attcker will get to know this situtation 


attacker will simply go to zendesk.com 

wil buy their support service 

after that they will add this subdomain (support.any.com ) as theirs own 

and they will succesfully claimed that this subdomain is belongs to an attacker because it wont verify on zendesk
